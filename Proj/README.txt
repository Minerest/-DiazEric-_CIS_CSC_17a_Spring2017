The "Intro" screen shot shows how the home screen look like before the game itself is actually set up.

The sample IO screen shot shows 1 move after the beginning of the game. At this point in the game,
the player placed 1 card from their hand at index 0 onto the field where the computer makes a move
immediately after. The hand shows the index of the card, the damage of each card, the type of card, and the name of the card.

At this point in time, the field has 2 cards placed, 1 on each side of the field. The player has 1 card dealing 5 damage placed
at the FIGHTER lane of the field and the computer has 1 card placed at the SIEGE lane of the field dealing 7 damage.
