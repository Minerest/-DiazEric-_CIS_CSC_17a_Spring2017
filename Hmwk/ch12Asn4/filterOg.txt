Get your Raspberry Pi web site on-line

Many people are using their Raspberry Pi as a home web server. It's a great way 
to host a small site without having to leave a PC running 24/7. 
If you want people to see your Raspberry Pi web site on the internet, 
you need to forward a domain name to your home IP address, and then forward a 
port on your router to your Pi. In this article I'm going to assume that you've 
already set up a web site and you need to just need to make it accessible on the web.


The diagram on the right shows a typical network set up for a Raspberry Pi. The 
Pi is connected to a router by wifi or ethernet. I use ethernet for my server 
as it's more stable.

The router has an external IP address which it uses to communicate with the 
internet, and it has another IP address which it uses to communicate with your
home network. Let's say the router's external IP address is 88.23.65.123. 
The router's internal address acts as a gateway for all the devices on your 
network. When your PC requests data from the internet, requests are automatically 
sent to the gateway address, and the router forwards the request to the internet. 
The gateway address is usually something like 192.168.0.1.

Most home routers have a firewall built-in. This stops people from outside of 
your home network connecting to your PC, but it allows your PC to make outgoing 
connections to web servers.
The external IP address of your home router is usually assigned by your ISP's 
DHCP servers. If you need to restart your router, it will make a new DHCP request 
to your ISP, and it may be given a new IP address.
